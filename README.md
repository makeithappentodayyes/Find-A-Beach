# Find-A-Beach






# Original Proposal

**Group Project Proposal from Evelyn, Daniel, William, and Alvin**
**Date:**  22 Oct 2019

**Project title** - Find A Beach (working title)

**Project description** - A user will find the nearest beach or list of beaches, depending on how many results they want.  They can select a beach from the generated list, and get a resulting Google directions map and the beach's weather right now and a weather forecast for the following 3 days.

**User story** - A person who is new to an area in the USA wants to know about the closest local beaches, with the weather per beach being the most important.  Such people might be tourists, travelers, and other visitors of a city.

**Wireframe or sketch of the design** - (Daniel has the notepad pages showing them; this is currently a text response.)

**APIs to be used** - Google Maps, OpenWeather API

**Rough breakdown of tasks -**
**Alvin:**  Google Maps related stuff
**Daniel**:  OpenWeather related stuff
**UI:**  Daniel for now, will transition to Evelyn (edited) 

Got the okay from Daniel to send this to Carl!!
